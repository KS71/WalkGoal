- **📊 Dashboard:** Get a full overview of your daily, weekly, and monthly progress directly on the front page.

- **📱 Android App (.apk):** Built as a native app via Capacitor, ready to install on your Android phone.

## 🔒 Data & Privacy

WalkGoal is built with a 100% focus on your privacy:
- **No Server:** The app sends **no** data, logs, or personal information to a cloud server.
- **Your Data is Yours:** Everything you enter (how far you walk, times, goals, etc.) is saved **locally on your own phone**. No one else but you has access to it.
- **Remember Backups:** Because the data is only on your device, it is **very important** that you regularly use the app's built-in "Backup" feature ("Export Data" in Settings). If you lose your phone or delete the app, your data is gone unless you have a backup file!
- **Future Account Management:** We are considering adding some form of account management in the future. Because this would require an online server (and thus go against the app's current core philosophy of 100% local data storage), it hasn't been finally decided yet. If it is ever developed, it will most likely be introduced as an active, voluntary choice (opt-in), so you can continue to use the app 100% locally and privately if you prefer.
